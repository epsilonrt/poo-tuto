# poo-tuto

Tutorial for implementing an object-based approach in embedded programming.

The chosen subject is the realization of a led chase with a Arduino, a Nano Pi or Raspberry Pi board in C ++ language. 

As we will use the [piduino](https://github.com/epsilonrt/piduino) library whose API is compatible with Arduino, we can also perform its activities with an Arduino board (with some adaptations that will be reported).

See [epsilonrt.fr](https://epsilonrt.fr/2019/02/programmation-orientee-objets-en-embarque).
